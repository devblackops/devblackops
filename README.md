### Ohai, I'm Brandon 👋

I'm a Staff Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) and a former [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003334?fullName=Brandon%20%20Olin) in Cloud and Datacenter Management.

I :heart: PowerShell. I'm the creator of [PoshBot](https://github.com/poshbotio/PoshBot) and [Terminal-Icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons), a maintainer of [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake), and a number of other [open-source tools](https://github.com/devblackops?tab=repositories).

>**I love to build interesting and helpful open-source tools to make sysadmins, IT pros, and developers' lives easier.**
